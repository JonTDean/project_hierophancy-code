# TDA: Persistent Homology

## Goal
Capture multi‑scale topological signatures (holes/loops) of the data manifold.

## Plan
- Vietoris–Rips persistence on embeddings or on geodesic distance matrices.
- Summaries: Betti curves, persistence diagrams/barcodes, Wasserstein matching across runs.

## Integration
- Compare partitions vs. topological signatures.
- Early stopping/selection: choose embedding dimension by stability of topological features.
