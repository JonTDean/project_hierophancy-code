# Visualization Hooks for Manifolds

## Graph
- Extend `MatplotlibVisualizer` with community hulls in embedding space.
- Edge transparency by geodesic length or curvature; node color by community.

## Matrix
- Heatmaps of (sorted) adjacency and Laplacian; eigenvalue spectra (scree).

## Vector
- Eigenvectors, diffusion coordinates, FlatNet layers, GLUE capacity curves.
