# Curvature on Graphs & Flows

## Goal
Summarize local geometry via discrete curvature and explore curvature‑guided smoothing and coarsening.

## Plan
- Offer Forman‑Ricci and Ollivier‑Ricci (optional dependency) with node/edge scores.
- Curvature‑aware edge reweighting to encourage manifold‑like neighborhoods.
- Experimental: Ricci flow on edge weights to uniformize geometry before embeddings.

## Outputs
- Curvature histograms, correlation with degrees/communities, and effect on embedding distortion.
