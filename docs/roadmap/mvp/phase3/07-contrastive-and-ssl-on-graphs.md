# Contrastive & Self-Supervised Learning on Graphs

## Tasks
- DGI/GRACE-style objectives: maximize agreement under graph augmentations.
- Bootstrap/self-distillation variants without negatives.
- Augmentations: edge dropout, diffusion biasing, curvature-aware reweighting.

## Evaluation
- Linear probe on downstream tasks; improvements in trustworthiness/continuity.
