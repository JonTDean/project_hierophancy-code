# Experiments & Benchmarks Pipeline

## Components
- Config-driven experiments (YAML/JSON), seeds, and deterministic dataloaders.
- Metrics: ARI/NMI, trustworthiness/continuity, distortion, ROC-AUC for links.
- Tables/plots exported as artifacts; regression baselines stored and compared.

## Datasets
- SBM variants, LFR, synthetic manifolds; optional OpenGraphBenchmark adaptors.
