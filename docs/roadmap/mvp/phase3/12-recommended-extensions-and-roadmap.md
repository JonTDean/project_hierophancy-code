# Recommended Extensions & Extras

## Heterogeneous & Higher-Order
- Typed nodes/edges, meta-paths; hypergraphs and simplicial complexes.

## Dynamics & Streaming
- Online community detection; temporal embeddings; drift and change-point alerts.

## Robustness & Fairness
- Noise-tolerant objectives; privacy-preserving training; bias checks on node attributes.

## Explainability
- GNNExplainer-like saliency; counterfactual edge perturbations; rule extraction for communities.

## Multi-View Fusion
- Co-regularized embeddings from multiple graphs; shared latent space alignment.

## Active Learning
- Query strategies to label nodes/edges that maximally reduce uncertainty.
