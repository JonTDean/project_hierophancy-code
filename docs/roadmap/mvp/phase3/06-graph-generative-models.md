# Graph Generative Models

## Scope
- Variational Graph Autoencoders for link prediction and embeddings.
- Normalizing flows for node embeddings; score-based diffusion on graphs.
- Conditional generation guided by community structure or curvature summaries.

## Outputs
- Embedding distributions; uncertainty estimates; synthetic graphs for tests.
