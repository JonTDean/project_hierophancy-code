# Theory Checks & Proofs Roadmap

## Targets
- Cheeger-type bounds: relate conductance to Laplacian spectra.
- Interlacing inequalities under aggregation.
- Correctness of modularity delta for weighted undirected graphs with self-loops.
- Diffusion distance equivalences and mixing-time diagnostics.

## Practice
- Numerical checks that verify inequalities within tolerances on fixtures.
- Property tests comparing pre/post-aggregation spectra and partitions.
