# Phase 3 — Math & Deep Learning Program (Overview)
**Date:** 2025-11-06

## Goal
Finalize the stack with provable objectives and differentiable models. Add GPU-accelerated training loops, rigorous math checks, and production-ready APIs to learn, infer, and explain community and manifold structure.

## Pillars
- Exact math where possible (spectral bounds, interlacing, modularity delta). 
- Differentiable surrogates for discrete objectives with soft assignments.
- GNN and manifold-aware layers for learning on graphs and supernodes.
- Reproducible experiments, ablations, and reporting.

## Deliverables
- Ports/adapters for training, objectives, embeddings, and evaluation.
- Reference implementations for hyperbolic/Euclidean models.
- Theory-check suite and numerical sanity tests.
